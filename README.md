Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language):

Use HTML for structuring the content of your web pages. Each page might include elements such as headers, footers, navigation menus, and sections for blog posts.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):

Apply CSS for styling your HTML elements. Ensure a responsive design that looks good on various devices. Consider using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap for a consistent and mobile-friendly layout.
Bootstrap:

Bootstrap is a front-end framework that simplifies the design process. Utilize its components for a clean and modern look, including its grid system for responsive layouts.
JavaScript:

Incorporate JavaScript for client-side interactivity. You might use it for form validation, handling asynchronous requests, or creating dynamic elements on the page.
Backend: Java, JSP, Servlets, JDBC:

Java:

Use Java for the backend logic. It could include handling user authentication, processing form submissions, and interacting with the database.
JSP (JavaServer Pages):

JSP allows embedding Java code within HTML pages, making it easier to generate dynamic content. Use JSP for displaying blog posts, user profiles, and other dynamic elements.
Servlets:

Servlets handle HTTP requests and responses. They can manage user sessions, process form submissions, and coordinate communication between the frontend and backend.
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity):

JDBC enables Java applications to interact with a relational database. Use it to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database, storing and retrieving blog posts, user information, and comments.
Database:

Set up a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store blog-related data. Design tables for users, blog posts, comments, etc.
User Authentication:

Implement user authentication using Java, Servlets, and sessions. Hash and salt passwords before storing them in the database for security.
Blog Management:

Develop functionality for creating, editing, and deleting blog posts. Use forms on the frontend to collect information and servlets/JSP to process and store it in the database.
Comments and Interaction:

Create a system for users to leave comments on blog posts. Ensure proper validation and moderation to manage user-generated content.
Search Functionality:

Implement a search feature using JDBC to query the database for relevant blog posts. This might involve using SQL queries and dynamically updating the page based on search results.
Responsive Design and User Experience:

Ensure a responsive design using Bootstrap and CSS, providing a seamless experience across different devices.
Security Measures:

Implement secure coding practices, input validation, and protection against common web vulnerabilities to enhance the overall security of the application.
